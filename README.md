===================Portfolio Website====================

This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my skills, projects, and background. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. The purpose of this site is to give a clear idea about who I am, what I do, and my aspirations as a developer, designer, and Ausbildung candidate in Germany.

Features----

>Responsive design for different devices

>Sections for About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact

>Clean and simple UI/UX design

Why I built this----

I wanted a place where I could put my work, projects, and information in one spot so that potential employers, mentors, and collaborators can review it easily.
